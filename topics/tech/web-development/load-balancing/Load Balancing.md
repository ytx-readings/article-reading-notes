# Load Balancing

## What is load balancing?

Load balancing is a strategy to average the load across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed. It is a critical component of any high-traffic website or application, as modern applications need to deal with millions of requests simultaneously and send back the responses as texts, videos, images, etc., quickly and reliably. To deal with such high amount of traffic, many websites have a lot of resource servers with duplicated content. Load balancing is an infrastructure built between users and resource servers, acting as an orchestrator to evenly distribute the incoming requests to the servers.

## Benefits of load balancing

### Application availability

Load balancers automatically detect the server problems and redirect client requests to other servers. This increases fault tolerance of the system and decreases the application downtime.

Benefits:

* Run application server maintenance or upgrades without application downtime
* Provide automatic disaster recovery to backup sites
* Perform health checks and prevent issues that can cause downtime

### Application scalability

You can direct network traffic intelligently among multiple servers. Load balancing enables your application to handle thousands of client requests.

Benefits:

* Prevents traffic bottlenecks at any one server
* Predicts application traffic so that you can add or remove different servers, if needed
* Adds redundancy to your system so that you can scale it with confidence

### Application security

Load balancers provided by cloud providers have built-in security features that adds an extra layer of security to your application. They are a useful tool against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. They also do the following:

* Monitor traffic and block malicious content
* Automatically redirect attack traffic to multiple backend servers to minimize impact
* Route traffic through a group of network firewalls for additional security
